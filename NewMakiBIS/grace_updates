	RESOLVED: 
	instead of this line $this->load->library('upload', $config);
	i changed it with $this->upload->initialize($config); since i was autoloading the library

	BUG: 
	1.image extension is still hard coded, still not able to alter the image extension (name is altered with the prescribed format)
	2.image not having the same file extension is not ovewritten

	FUNCTION CREATED:
		do_upload (c)
		update_image (m)

	RESOLVED
	1. see else part of do_upload
